### Investigating and Visualizing Subjective Well-Being Around the World
The aim of this project is to explore and gain insight into a dataset with the help of visualizations and other techniques of exploratory data analysis. For this purpose, a dataset was selected that contains data on subjective well-being (SWB) from various countries around the world. With the help of different visualizations, different regions and countries of the world are compared with each other in terms of their SWB and relationships of SWB with the life expectancy are examined.

This project contains all scripts and data required for the exploratory data analysis and visualization of the selected data set.
